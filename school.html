				<h2>Physics Simulator</h2>
				<p>For my Junior and Senior Projects, I wanted to challenge myself and learn something I had not known before. I chose a physics simulator to allow me to learn more about physics and computer 3D graphics.</p>
				<p>In the junior version (pictured), I manually did the physics. It was mobile friendly, and allowed customization of the physics equations</p>
				<p>In the senior version of the project, I used a third party library, and I upgraded the interface. This allowed the simulator to handle more situations. However, it also made it worse at the plotting that the junior version was capable of.</p>

				<h2>Laser Text Projector</h2>
				<p>In this project, my intent was to use a single laser, redirect the beam with mirrors, and, depending on where the beam is directed, turn the laser on or off. This method is raster scanning.</p>
				<p>I came up with this idea before I took COMP430/System Fundamentals, and the class was the perfect opportunity for me to implement my idea. Some of the things I came up with included a polygon scanner, but I looked it up and that existed. I ended up using a polygon scanner from a laser printer to scan the laser (pictured).</p>
